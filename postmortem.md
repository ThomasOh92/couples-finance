#### Approach and Process
What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
- Focus on one task at a time, instead of trying to fix/build multiple things on the fly
- Sometimes using a single monitor/screen is better because it makes you really drill down and think clearly
- Declare variables ahead of time, even if you are using it once or twice. It makes the code a lot more readable for others



What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
- Keeping my code organised, planning ahead with diagrams
- Being willing to push outside of my comfort zone to try to work with things that seem really difficult (e.g. Google Drive API)

#### Code and Code Design
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
- I think i could have broken it up into more components
- The UI for the dashboard page could be better
- There are a few parts like this, where I should have used variable names. Its super unreadable

        "stickyNote.xcoord = await noteBoard.children[i].children[0].offsetLeft;
        stickyNote.ycoord =  await noteBoard.children[i].children[0].offsetTop;

        stickyNote.width = noteBoard.children[i].children[0].children[1].children[0].style.width;
        stickyNote.height = noteBoard.children[i].children[0].children[1].children[0].style.height;

        stickyNote.content = noteBoard.children[i].children[0].children[1].children[0].value;
        stickyNote.username = noteBoard.children[i].children[0].children[1].children[2].innerText
        stickyNoteTransferData.push(stickyNote)""

- Furthers I would have liked - graphics for the dashboard, fleshed out google drive integration



What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
- Sticky notes functionality works well, same css concepts can apply again (x and y coordinates within the block)




#### WDI Unit 2 Post Mortem
What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
- Planning ahead and staying organised
- Willingness to learn, push out of comfort zone

What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
- Staying focused on a single task when coding, instead of trying to do multiple things on the fly


How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
- Good! Would have liked a summary on how things fit together tho
